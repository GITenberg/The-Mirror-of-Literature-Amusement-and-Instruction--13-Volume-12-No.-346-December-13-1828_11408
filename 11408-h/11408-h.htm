<h2>OLD COVENT GARDEN.</h2>
<div class="figure" style="width:60%;"><a href=
"images/346-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/346-1.png" alt=
"Old Covent Garden" /></a></div>
<p>The notoriety of Covent Garden is of too multifarious a
description to render the above illustration uninteresting to
either of our readers. It is copied from one of Hollar's prints,
and represents the Garden about the time of Charles II., before its
area had been polluted with filth and vegetable odours.</p>
<p>The spot was originally the garden belonging to the abbot of
Westminster, which extended to St. Martin's church, was called the
<i>Convent Garden</i>, and may be distinctly traced in Ralph Agar's
View of London, bearing date about 1570. It was granted, after the
dissolution, by Edward VI. first to the protector Somerset, on
whose attainder, in 1582, it passed into the Bedford family. About
the year 1634, Francis, Earl of Bedford, began to clear away the
old buildings, and to form the present handsome square. Its
execution was confided to Inigo Jones, but unfortunately, only the
north, and part of the east side, was completed; for, had the
piazza been continued on the other this would have been one of the
noblest quadrangles in the metropolis. Previously to the erection
of the present mass of huts and sheds, the area was neatly
gravelled, had a handsome dial in the centre, and was railed in on
all sides, at the distance of sixty feet from the buildings. The
south side was bounded by the garden wall of Bedford-House, the
town house of the noble family of that name; and along this wall
only were the market booths. But the mansion has long given way to
Little Bedford-street.</p>
<p>The most striking object in the engraving is, however, the
original church of St. Paul, as built by Inigo Jones, connected
with which is the following anecdote:&mdash;When the Earl of
Bedford sent for Jones, in 1640, he told him he wanted a chapel for
the parishioners of Covent Garden; but added, he would not go to
any considerable expense. "In short," said he, "I would not have it
much better than a barn."&mdash;"Well, then," replied Jones, "you
shall have the handsomest barn in England." The ceiling was very
beautifully painted by Edward Pierce, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page402" name="page402"></a>[pg 402]</span> sen. a pupil of
Vandyke. In 1795, the church was accidentally destroyed by fire,
but it was rebuilt by Mr. Hardwick, in imitation of the original
design.</p>
<p>In a note at page 236 of vol. x. of the MIRROR, we adverted to
the disgraceful state of Covent Garden Market, which of late years
has been little better than a public nuisance. The broom of reform
at length promises to cleanse this <i>Augean</i> area; and a new
market is in the course of erection. The design, it will be
recollected, was in this year's Exhibition at Somerset House, and
in an early Number we may probably give a view of the
Elevation.</p>
<p>The celebrity of Covent Garden as a depot for vegetable produce
is of considerable antiquity; and it is but reasonable that such an
improvement should be made, consistent with the increased and
increasing wants of this overgrown metropolis, and the augmented
supplies which are poured in from all quarters. When this
improvement is completed, it may lead to the finishing of the
quadrangle. The parish (in extent, not in feeling) is, perhaps, one
of the most compact in London; but when its proximity to the
theatres is considered, little surprise can reasonably be felt at
the immorality of the district. It may not be so easy a matter to
mend the public morals as to build new markets; but the links of
popular improvement are too closely connected to make the case
hopeless.</p>
<p>It would be amusing to compare this emporium of fruits and
vegetables in ancient and modern times. At the first enclosure of
Covent Garden, in 1635, the supply must have been very scanty. Upon
the authority of Hume, we learn that when Catherine, queen of Henry
VIII., was in want of any salads, carrots, or other edible roots,
&amp;c. she was obliged to send a special messenger to Holland for
them. But the mention of water-cresses, kales, gooseberries,
currants, &amp;c., by old writers, appears to invalidate the pursy
historian. The garden must, nevertheless, have presented a very
different appearance to that of our day. Only let the
<i>gourmand</i> take a walk through the avenues of the present
Covent Garden&mdash;from the imperial pine, to the emerald leaves
sprinkled with powdered diamonds&mdash;<i>vulgo</i>, savoys. Then
the luscious list of autumnal fruits, and the peppers, or
capsicums, and tomatas, to tickle the appetite of the veriest
epicure of east or western London&mdash;not to mention the exotic
fragrance of oranges, which come in just opportunely to fill up the
chasm in the supply of British fruits.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Ancient Roman Festivals</h3>
<h3>DECEMBER.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>The feasts of <i>Opalia</i> were celebrated in honour of the
goddess <i>Ops</i>; they were held on the 9th of December. Saturn
and Ops were husband and wife, and to them we owe the introduction
of corn and fruits; for which reason the feast was not held till
the harvest and fruit time were over. The vows offered to this
goddess were made sitting on the ground, to show that she was
Earth, the mother of all things.</p>
<p>The <i>Saturnalia</i> were festivals in honour of Saturn,
celebrated the 16th or 17th, or, according to others, the 18th of
December. They were instituted long before the foundation of Rome,
in commemoration of the freedom and equality which prevailed on
earth in the golden reign of Saturn. Some, however, suppose that
the Saturnalia were first observed at Rome in the reign of Tullus
Hostilius, after a victory obtained over the Sabines; while others
support, that Janus first instituted them in gratitude to Saturn,
from whom he had learnt agriculture; others suppose that they were
first celebrated in the year of Rome 257, after a victory obtained
over the Latins by the dictator, Posthumius. The Saturnalia were
originally celebrated only for one day, but afterwards the
solemnity continued for three, four, five, and at last for seven
days. The celebration was remarkable for the license which
universally prevailed. The slaves were permitted to ridicule their
masters, and to speak with freedom upon any subject. It was usual
for friends to make presents one to another; all animosity ceased;
no criminals were executed; schools were shut; war was never
declared, but all was mirth, riot, and debauchery. In the
sacrifices the priests made their offerings with their heads
uncovered,&mdash;a custom which was never observed at other
festivals.</p>
<p>The <i>Divalia</i> was a feast held on the 2lst of December, in
honour of the goddess <i>Angerona</i>, whence it is also called
Angeronalia. On the day of this festival the pontifices performed
sacrifices in the temple of Voluptia, or the goddess of joy and
pleasure, who, some say, was the same with <i>Angerona</i>, and
supposed to drive away all the sorrow and chagrin of life.</p>
<p>The feast of <i>Laurentinalia</i> was held on the 23rd of
December, but was ordered to be observed twice a year by Augustus;
by some supposed to be in honour of the <i>Lares</i>, a kind of
domestic genii, or divinities, worshipped in houses, and esteemed
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page403" name="page403"></a>[pg
403]</span> guardians and protectors of families, supposed to
reside in chimney-corners. Others have attributed this feast in
honour of Acca Laurentia, the nurse of Romulus and Remus, and wife
of Faustulus.</p>

<h3>CELTIC ETYMOLOGIES.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p><i>Hibernia</i>.&mdash;Ireland is called by the Latin writers,
<i>Hibernia, Ivernia&mdash;Ierne</i><a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>&mdash;and
<i>Verna</i>&mdash;names differing but little in sound, and all,
merely Latinizations of the Irish words <i>Ibh Eirin</i>&mdash;that
is, the Land of Eri&eacute;&mdash;for <i>Ibh</i>, in Irish,
signifies a land, or country, and <i>Eirin</i> is the genitive case
of <i>Eire</i>, the name of Ireland in the Irish tongue&mdash;from
<i>Ibh Eirin</i> the Romans formed Hibernia, &amp;c. the
termination only being Latin&mdash;and from <i>Eire</i>, by adding
<i>land</i>, the Saxons formed <i>Eireland</i> or <i>Ireland</i>.
This Eire was a very ancient queen who gave her name to the
country, as in modern times <i>Virginia</i> was called after Queen
Elizabeth, <i>Maryland</i> after the queen of Charles I.,
&amp;c.</p>
<p><i>Tory</i>.&mdash;A robber, an outlaw, literally, <i>one
hunted</i>&mdash;a name originally given to the outlawed Irish
chiefs of Ulster, in the reign of James I., who after the seizure
of their lands, had a price set upon their heads, and were
<i>hunted</i> by the soldiery like wild beasts; hence the name of
<i>Tories</i>, meaning the <i>hunted</i> people, for
<i>Toriacht</i> in Irish signifies a pursuit or hunting, and
<i>Torihe</i>, hunted. In the reign of Charles II. it began to be
used to designate a party in the state favourable to absolute
monarchy; many of these "Tories" having followed the fortunes of
that prince in exile, returned with him, and being his most devoted
partisans when reseated on his throne.</p>
<p><i>Admiral</i>.&mdash;This word, which appears to have sadly
puzzled the etymologists, having been derived from the Phoenician,
the Coptic, and half a dozen languages besides, is pure Celtic, but
little altered too, in its transit from one language to another.
<i>Ard</i>, high or chief, <i>Muir</i>, the sea, and <i>Fear</i>,
(in composition pronounced <i>ar</i>) a man, so that
<i>Ardmurar</i>, or <i>Admiral</i>, signifies literally the
<i>Chief Seaman</i>. There is nothing of torture in this
derivation, as may be seen by referring to any Irish dictionary,
and it is a curious fact, that the Irish seamen in the navy very
generally call the Admiral "<i>the Ardmurar</i>." In Irish it is
frequently written in two words, thus&mdash;<i>Ard
muirfhear</i>.</p>
<p><i>Beltin day</i>.&mdash;The first of May is so called in many
places in the North of England. It was a custom in the days of
Druidism to light large fires on the tops of hills on the evening
of the first of May, in honour of <i>Bel</i> or the Sun, and hence
that day is still called in Irish, <i>La Bheltine</i>, or the day
of Bel's fire, from <i>La</i>, a day, <i>Bel</i>, the god Bel, and
<i>teine</i>, fire. The same ceremony was practised in Britain,
being a Druidical rite, and the name (<i>Beltin day</i>) remains,
although the custom from which it originated, has in England, at
least, been long forgotten.</p>
<p>Guthrie, in his "Geographical Grammar," tells us, that the
English language is a compound of the Saxon, the French, and the
<i>Celtic</i>. As far as this latter is concerned, the assertion
appears to me to have been made without due consideration; I do not
believe that there are twenty words of <i>genuine Celtic</i> in the
English language; there are, it is true, a very few Irish words,
which have become as it were, English denizens, and of these I have
sent you a specimen above; but I do not believe it possible to
increase their number to twenty, even in broad Scotch, in which
dialect of the Saxon (from the neighbourhood of the Highlanders who
use the Irish language) some Celtic words might be expected, but
very few occur;<a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> there is,
however, one very curious exception to this rule, and for which, I
confess, I am unable to account, (though perhaps your
correspondent, <i>Rupert C.</i> in No. 342, might,) it is
this&mdash;that in Grose's <i>Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, or
Cant Language</i>, if the words which are evidently figurative be
thrown out, nearly the whole of what remain are pure Irish.</p>
<p>H.S.</p>

<h3>TURKISH CANNON.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>The Turks use the largest cannon of any people in Europe. In our
ships, and I believe in our batteries, we seldom use a heavier gun
than a 32-pounder. No man-of-war carries a gun of a larger calibre;
but the Turks make use of 800-pounders. Mahommed II. is stated to
have used at the siege of Constantinople, in 1453, cannon of an
immense calibre, and stone shot. When Sir J. Duckworth passed the
Dardanelles to attack Constantinople, in 1807, his fleet was
dreadfully shattered by the immense shot thrown from the batteries.
The Royal George (of 110 guns) was nearly sunk by only one shot,
which carried away her cut-water, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page404" name="page404"></a>[pg 404]</span> and another cut the
main-mast of the Windsor Castle nearly in two; a shot knocked two
ports of the Thunderer into one; the Repulse (74) had her wheel
shot away and twenty-four men killed and wounded by a single shot,
nor was the ship saved but by the most wonderful exertions. The
heaviest shot which struck our ships was of granite, and weighed
800 pounds, and was two feet two inches in diameter. One of these
huge shots, to the astonishment of our tars, stove in the whole
larboard bow of the Active; and having thus crushed this immense
mass of timber, the shot rolled ponderously aft, and brought up
abreast the main hatchway, the crew standing aghast at the singular
spectacle. One of these guns was cast in brass in the reign of
Amurath; it was composed of two parts, joined by a screw at the
chamber, its breach resting against massy stone work; the
difficulty of charging it would not allow of its being fired more
than once; but, as a Pacha said, "that single discharge would
destroy almost the whole fleet of an enemy." The Baron de Trott, to
the great terror of the Turks, resolved to fire this gun. The shot
weighed 1,100 pounds, and he loaded it with 330 pounds of powder:
he says, "I felt a shock like an earthquake, at the distance of
eight hundred fathoms. I saw the ball divide into three pieces, and
these fragments of a rock crossed the Strait, and rebounded on the
mountain."</p>

<h3>ORIGIN OF THE WORD BANKRUPT.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>This word is formed from the ancient Latin <i>bancus</i> a
<i>bench</i>, or <i>table</i>, and <i>ruptus, broken</i>. Bank
originally signified a bench, which the first bankers had in the
public places, in markets, fairs, &amp;c. on which they told their
money, wrote their bills of exchange, &amp;.c. Hence, when a banker
failed, they broke his bank, to advertise the public that the
person to whom the bank belonged was no longer in a condition to
continue his business. As this practice was very frequent in Italy,
it is said the term bankrupt is derived from the Italian
<i>banco</i> rotto, broken bench. Cowel (in his 4th Institute 227)
rather chooses to deduce the word from the French <i>banque,
table</i>, and <i>route, vestigium, trace</i>, by metaphor from the
sign left in the ground, of a table once fastened to it and now
gone. On this principle he traces the origin of bankrupts from the
ancient Roman <i>mensarii</i> or <i>argentarii</i>, who had their
<i>tabernae</i> or <i>mensae</i> in certain public places; and who,
when they fled, or made off with the money that had been entrusted
to them, left only the sign or shadow of their former station
behind them.</p>
<p>P.T.W.</p>
<hr />
<h3>ORIGIN OF THE WORD <i>BROKER</i>, &amp;c.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>The origin of this word is contested; some derive it from the
French <i>broyer, "to grind</i>;" others from <i>brocader, to cavil
or riggle</i>; others deduce broker from a trader <i>broken</i>,
and that from the Saxon <i>broc</i>, "misfortune," which is often
the true reason of a man's breaking. In which view, a broker is a
broken trader, by misfortune; and it is said that none but such
were formerly admitted to that <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page405" name="page405"></a>[pg 405]</span> employment. The Jews,
Armenians, and Banians are the chief brokers throughout most parts
of the Levant and the Indies. In Persia, all affairs are transacted
by a sort of brokers, whom they call "<i>delal</i>" i.e. "<i>great
talkers</i>." Their form of contract in buying and selling is
remarkable, being done in the profoundest silence, only by touching
each other's fingers:&mdash;The buyer, loosening his
<i>pamerin</i>, or girdle, spreads it on his knee; and both he and
the seller, having their hands underneath, by the intercourse of
the fingers, mark the price of pounds, shillings, &amp;c.,
demanded, offered, and at length agreed on. When the seller takes
the buyer's whole hand, it denotes a thousand, and as many times as
he squeezes it, as many thousand pagods or roupees, according to
the species in question demanded; when he only takes the five
fingers, it denotes five hundred; and when only one, one hundred;
taking only half a finger, to the second joint, denotes fifty; the
small end of the finger, to the first joint, stands for ten. This
<i>legerdemain</i>, or <i>squeezing system</i>, would not do for
the <i>latitude</i> of London.</p>

<h2>SELECT BIOGRAPHY</h2>
<hr />
<h3>DR. GALL.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>The loss which the scientific world has lately sustained by the
death of Dr. Gall, will be longer and more deeply felt than any
which it has experienced for some years. This celebrated
philosopher and physician was born in the year 1758, of respectable
parents, at a small village in the duchy of Baden, where he
received the early part of his education. He afterwards went to
Brucksal, and then to Strasburgh, in which city he commenced his
medical studies, and became a pupil of the celebrated Professor
Hermann. From Strasburgh he removed to Vienna, where he commenced
practice, having taken the degree of M.D. In this capital, however,
he was not permitted to develope his new system of the functions of
the brain; and from his lectures being interdicted, and the
illiberal opposition which he here met with, as well as in other
parts of Austria, he determined to visit the north of Germany. Here
he was well received in all the cities through which he passed, as
well as in Prussia, Sweden, and Denmark, and explained the
doctrines he had founded on his observations from <i>nature</i>
before several sovereigns, who honoured him with such marks of
approbation and respect as were due to his talents. In the course
of his travels he likewise visited England, and at length, in 1807,
settled in Paris, where his reputation had already preceded him,
and which, from its central situation, he considered as the fittest
place for disseminating his system. In this city, in 1810, he
published his elaborate work on the brain, the expenses of which
were guaranteed by one of his greatest friends and patrons, Prince
Metternich, at that time Austrian minister at the court of
France.</p>
<p>It was natural to expect that the system of Dr. Gall, which
differed so widely from the long confirmed habits of thinking, and
having to contend with so many prejudices, should encounter a large
host of adversaries; for if <i>phrenology</i> be true, all other
systems of the philosophy of the human mind must consequently be
false. The brain, which, from the earliest periods, has generally
been considered as the seat of our mental functions, Dr. Gall
regards as a congeries of organs, each organ having a separate
function of its own. This system, first promulgated by him, is now
rapidly advancing in the estimation of the world; and its
doctrines, which a few years since were thought too extravagant and
absurd for investigation, are now discussed in a more liberal and
candid manner. The <i>test</i> for the science of phrenology, and a
test by which its validity alone can be tried, consists in an
induction of facts and observations; and by this mode it is that
the disciples of Gall and Spurzheim challenge their
antagonists.</p>
<p>After a life of the most indefatigable industry and active
benevolence, Dr. Gall breathed his last at his country house at
Montrouge, a short distance from Paris, on August the 22nd, 1828,
at the age of seventy-one. The examination of his body took place
forty hours after death, in the presence of the following members
of the faculty:&mdash;Messrs. Fouquier, J. Cloquet, Dauncey,
Fossati, Cassimir-Broussais, Robouane, Sarlandi&egrave;re,
Fabre-Palaprat, Londe, Costello, Gaubert, Vimont, Jobert, and
Marotti. The exterior appearance of the body presented a
considerable falling away, particularly in the face. The skull was
sawed off with the greatest precaution; the substance of the brain
was consistent, and this organ was firm and perfectly regular.</p>
<p>The funeral of Dr. Gall, which was conducted with as much
privacy as possible, took place at Paris on the 27th of August. He
was interred in the burial-ground of P&egrave;re la Chaise, between
the tombs of Moli&egrave;re and La Fontaine, being attended to the
grave by several members of the faculty. Three <i>eloges</i>, or
<i>oraisons fun&egrave;bres</i>, were delivered at the place of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page406" name="page406"></a>[pg
406]</span> interment by Professor Broussais, Dr. Fossati, and Dr.
Londe.</p>
<p>Broussais informs us, that Dr. Gall possessed most of the social
virtues, particularly beneficence and good-nature&mdash;qualities,
he observes, precious in all ranks of society, and which ought to
make amends for many defects; but for Gall, they had only to
palliate a certain roughness of character, which might wound the
susceptibility of delicate persons, although the sick and
unfortunate never had to complain; and, indeed, the doctor ought,
in strict justice, to have more merit in our ideas, from never
having once lost sight, in his writings, of either decency or
moderation, particularly when it is remembered how severely he was
attacked in propagating his favourite doctrine.</p>

<p>Germany! land of mystery and of mind! birth-place of Schiller
and Go&euml;the, with what emotions does not every lover of romance
sit down to peruse thy own peculiar, dreamy traditions! Thy very
name conjures up visions of demons, and imps, and elfs, and all the
creations of faery land, with their varied legends of
<i>diablerie</i>, almost incredible in number and singular in
detail&mdash;and romance, in his gloomy mood, seems here to have
reared his strong hold.</p>
<p>At a time when a taste for the beauties of German literature is
becoming general throughout this country, we conceive that a few
specimens of her traditions may not be unacceptable to the reader.
Few subjects are more interesting than the popular legends of a
country, which are the source from whence many of our later
novelists draw several of their writings: they offer a field for
reflection to the contemplative observer of man; and those of
Germany, although some are disfigured with a little too much
absurdity in their details, are confessedly a mine of wealth to the
lover of research in such matters. Here Schiller first drew the
sources of his inspiration; here Go&euml;the first electrified
mankind with his writings&mdash;works which will render both
immortal; it is, indeed, a mine which has been and will bear much
working.</p>
<p>We have chosen the following tradition, both on account of the
merit it possesses, and its being the unquestionable origin of
Washington Irving's inimitable <i>Rip Von Winkle</i>. Indeed, the
similarity of the story is strikingly obvious. We believe there are
several legends on this subject, which, with the present, probably
all refer to the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa, whose adventures form
the source of many a story among the Germans. The original tale is
nearly as follows:&mdash;It seems the emperor was once compelled to
conceal himself, with a party of his followers, amongst the
Kyffha&uuml;sen mountains; there he still lives, but is under the
influence of magic. He sits with his adherents on a seat before a
stone table, leaning his head upon his hands, seeming to slumber;
but apparently his sleep is very restless, and his head nods, and
seems as if he were going to awake, and his red beard has grown
through the table down to his feet. He takes pretty long naps, not
more than a hundred years in length at a stretch: when his slumber
is interrupted, he is fabled to be very fond of music; and it is
said that there was a party of musicians, who once gave him a
regular serenade in his subterranean retreat, doubtless expecting
some wonderful token of his generosity in return; but they received
nothing for their pains but a number of green boughs, which so
disgusted them, that they all threw them away on their return to
earth, save one, who, however, had no suspicion of its worth, for
on showing it to his wife, to his great astonishment, each leaf
became a golden coin.</p>
<p>An author before us observes, that this tale of the emperor's
slumbers cannot, perhaps, be deemed original, and is probably a
popular version of the Seven Sleepers, "not a little disfigured by
the peculiar superstition of the country." The same writer remarks,
with justice, that it is surprising how few are the sources, and
how scanty the parent stock, from whence all the varieties of
European legend are derived. Indeed, the foundation of a great part
of these legendary stories seems to have been the heathen mythology
of the different countries, and the various tales of superstition
being handed down from one generation to another, have gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page407" name="page407"></a>[pg
407]</span> assumed the shape they now bear; from whence may be
traced most of our popular superstitions.</p>

</div>
<p>At the peaceful village of Sittendorf dwelt Peter Klaus, the
goatherd. He daily tended his flocks to pasture in the
Kyffh&auml;usen mountains, and never failed, as evening approached,
to muster them in a little mead, surrounded by a stone wall,
preparatory to driving them home; for some time, however, he had
observed, that one of the finest of his herd regularly disappeared
soon after coming to this nook, and did not join her companions
till late. One night, watching her attentively, he remarked that
she slipped through a hole or opening in the wall, on which he
cautiously crept after the animal, and found she was in a cave,
busily engaged in gleaning the grains of corn that fell down singly
from the roof. Peter did not look long before the shower of corn
that now saluted him made him shake his ears, and inflamed his
curiosity the more to discover the cause of so singular an
occurrence in that out-of-the-way place. However, at last he heard
the neigh and stamping of horses, apparently proceed from above;
and it was doubtless from their mangers that the oats had
fallen.</p>
<p>While standing, still wrapped in amazement at the singularity of
the adventure, Peter's surprise was not diminished on observing a
boy, who, without saying a word, silently beckoned him to follow.
Peter mechanically obeyed the gestures of the lad, and ascended
some steps, which led over a walled court into a hollow place,
completely surrounded on all sides by lofty rocks, and crowned by
the rich foliage of shrubs, through which an imperfect twilight
displayed a smooth, well-trimmed lawn, that formed the ground he
stood upon. Here were twelve knights, who, without so much as
uttering a syllable, were very gravely playing at nine-pins; and as
silently was Peter inducted into the office of assistant, namely,
in setting up these nine-pins. Peter's courage was none of the
strongest during all this time, and his knees smote each other most
devoutly as he commenced his duties; while he occasionally ventured
to steal a glance at the venerable knights, whose long beards and
antique slashed doublets filled him with profound awe.</p>
<p>His fears, however, began to be on the wane, as he became more
accustomed to his new employment. Indeed, he went so far as to gaze
on one of the noble knights straight in the face&mdash;nay, even at
last ventured to sip out of a bowl of wine that stood near him,
which diffused a most delicious odour around. He found this sip so
invigorating, that he soon took a somewhat longer pull; and in a
short time Peter had quite forgotten that such things as
Sittendorf, Wife, or Goats had ever existed; and on finding himself
the least weary, he had only to apply to the never-failing goblet.
At last he fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>On waking, Peter found he was in the same little enclosure where
he was wont to count his flocks. He shook himself well, and rubbed
his eyes; but neither dog nor goats were to be seen; and he was
astonished in no slight degree to observe that he was nearly
surrounded with high grass, and trees, and shrubs, which he never
before remarked, growing about that spot. Lost in perplexity, he
followed his way to all the different haunts he had frequented with
his herds, but no traces of them were to be discovered; at last he
hastily bent his steps to Sittendorf, which lay beneath.</p>
<p>The persons whom he met on his way to the village were all
strangers to him; they were differently dressed, and did not
precisely speak the language of his acquaintance; and on inquiring
after his goats, all stared and touched their chins. At last he
mechanically did the same, but what was his surprise when he found
his beard lengthened at least a foot; on which he began to conclude
that he and those around him were all under the influence of magic
or enchantment. Yet the mountain he had descended was certainly the
Kyffh&auml;usen&mdash;the cottages, too, with their gardens and
enclosures, were all quite familiar to him&mdash;and he heard some
boys reply to the passing questions of a traveller, that it was
Sittendorf.</p>
<p>His doubt and perplexity now increased every moment, and he
quickened his steps towards his own dwelling; he hardly knew it, it
was so much decayed; and before the door lay a strange goatherd's
boy, with a dog apparently at the last extreme of age, that snarled
when he spoke to him. He entered the house through an opening,
which had formerly been closed by a door. All was waste and void
within; he staggered out as if he had lost his senses, calling on
his wife and children by their names; but no one heard&mdash;none
answered. Before long, a crowd of women <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page408" name="page408"></a>[pg 408]</span> and
children had collected around the strange old man, with the long
hoary beard, and all inquired what it was he was seeking after.
This was almost too much; to be thus questioned before his own door
was more than strange, and he felt ashamed to ask after his wife
and children, or even of himself; but to get rid of his querists he
mentioned the first name that occurred to him, "Kurt Steffen?" The
people looked around in silence, till at length an old woman said,
"He has been in the churchyard these twelve years past, and you'll
not go thither to-day."&mdash;"Velten Meier?"&mdash;"Heaven rest
his soul!" replied an ancient dame, leaning on a crutch. "Heaven
rest his soul! he has lain in the house he will never leave these
fifteen years!"</p>
<p>The goatherd shuddered to recognise in the last speaker his next
neighbour, who seemed all at once to have grown old; but he had
lost all desire to inquire further. Suddenly a smart young woman
pressed through the surrounding gapers, with an infant in her arms,
and leading a girl about fourteen years old&mdash;all three the
exact image of his wife. With greater surprise than ever he
inquired her name. "Maria!"&mdash;"And your father's
name?"&mdash;"Peter Klaus! Heaven rest his soul! It is now twenty
years since his goats returned without him, and we sought for him
in vain day and night in the Kyffh&auml;usen mountains&mdash;I was
then hardly seven years old."</p>
<p>Our goatherd could no longer contain himself. "I am Peter
Klaus!" he roared, "I am Peter Klaus, and no one else!" and he
caught the child from his daughter's arms. Every one, for an
instant, stood as if petrified, till at length one voice, and
another, and then another, exclaimed, "Yes, this is, indeed, Peter
Klaus! welcome, neighbour! welcome, after twenty years!"</p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY</h2>

<h3>ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.</h3>
<p>Since our last visit, many of the tenants have begun to
<i>hybernate</i>, and tasteful erections have been made for their
winter quarters in all parts of the gardens. Several others are in
progress, and a semi-circular aviary for British birds is already
built. The <i>season</i> is far advanced, and there have been but
few <i>arrivals</i> of late. The <i>emus'</i> grounds have been
enclosed with elegant iron-work, and several removals or
<i>changes</i> have taken place. Some of the animals are much
affected by the cold weather. Thus, the monkeys have left their
houses on poles, and retired to enclosed cages, where they nestle
in groups of threes and fours, and amuse themselves by teazing the
least of their company; for here, as elsewhere, the weakest goes to
the wall. Three fine wolves, previously shut up in a small den, now
enjoy a large cage, where they appear much invigorated by the
bracing season. Here and there a little animal lies curled up in
the corner of his cage, in a state of torpidity. Among the birds,
the macaws were holding an in-door council in their robes of state;
whilst one fine fellow, in blue coat and yellow waistcoat, perched
himself outside the aviary, and by his cries, proved that fine
colours were not weather-proof. The snowy plumage of the storks was
"tempered to the wind;" but they reminded us of their original
abode&mdash;the wilderness. The eagles and vultures in the circular
aviary sat on their perches, looking melancholy and disconsolate,
but well protected from cold. The kangaroos have removed into their
new house, and their park has been relaid, although they still look
unsettled. A very pretty beaver-house has been built of mimic
rocks.</p>
<p>Among the <i>introductions</i>, or new faces, we noticed a pair
of fine mastiffs from Cuba, and two Thibet watch-dogs. One of the
latter stood shivering in the cold, with bleared eyes, and crying
"like a lubberly postmaster's boy." The three bears exhibited as
much good-breeding as the visiters encouraged,&mdash;climbing to
the top of the pole when there was any thing to climb after, and an
Admiralty expedition could do no more.</p>
<p><i>Poisoning of Vegetables</i>.</p>
<p>Several very curious experiments on the poisoning of vegetables,
have recently been made by M. Marcet, of Geneva.&mdash;His
experiments on arsenic, which is well known to every one as a
deadly poison to animals, were thus conducted. A vessel containing
two or three bean plants, each of five or six leaves, was watered
with two ounces of water, containing twelve grains of oxide of
arsenic in solution. At the end of from twenty-four to thirty-six
hours, the plants had faded, the leaves drooped, and had even begun
to turn yellow; the roots remained fresh, and appeared to be
living. Attempts to restore the plants after twelve or eighteen
hours, by abundant watering, failed to recover them. The leaves and
stem of the dead plant gave, upon chemical examination, traces of
arsenic. A branch of a rose-tree, including a flower, was gathered
just as the rose began to blow; the stem was put into a vessel,
containing a solution of six grains of oxide of arsenic in an ounce
of water. The flower and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page409"
name="page409"></a>[pg 409]</span> leaves soon showed symptoms of
disease, and on the fifth day the whole branch was withered and
dead, though only one-fifth of a grain of arsenic had been
absorbed. Similar stems, placed in pure water, had, after five
days, the roses fully expanded, and the leaves fresh and green.</p>
<p>On June 1st, a slit of one inch and a half in length was made in
the stem of a lilac tree, the branch being about an inch in
diameter. The slit extended to the pith. Fifteen or twenty grains
of moistened arsenic were introduced, the cut was closed, and the
stem retained in its original position by osier ties. On the 8th,
the leaves began to roll up at the extremity; on the 28th, the
branches were dry, and, in the second week of July, the whole of
the stem was dry, and the tree itself dead. In about fifteen days
after the first, a tree, which joined the former a little above the
earth, shared the same fate, in consequence of its connexion with
that into which the poison had been introduced. Other trees
similarly cut, but without having been poisoned, suffered no kind
of injury.</p>
<p>M. Marcet's experiments upon vegetable poisons are no less
interesting, and still more wonderful, as indicating a degree of
irritability in plants somewhat similar to that which depends on
the nervous system in animals. After having ascertained that the
bean plants could exist in a healthy state for five or six days, if
immersed in the same quantity of spring water, he tried them with
five or six grains of opium dissolved in an ounce of water, the
consequence of which was, that in the evening the leaves had
dropped, and, by the middle of next day, they were dead beyond
recovery. Other vegetable poisons of the narcotic class produced a
similar effect. Hemlock was equally fatal, and six grains of dry
powdered foxglove, in an ounce of water, began to operate, by
wrinkling some of the leaves of the bean in a few moments, which it
completely killed in twenty-four hours. Oxalic acid or salt of
sorrel, though found in common and wood sorrel, and a great many
plants, proved a very fatal poison to others. The absorption of
one-tenth of a grain, killed a rose branch and flower in
forty&mdash;eight hours.&mdash;</p>

<h2>NOTES OF A READER</h2>
<hr />
<h3>KNOWING PEOPLE.</h3>
<p>How happily do these few lines characterize a certain set of
people who pick up news from "good authority," and settle the fate
of the nation over strong potations of brandy and water, or
Calvert's porter, forgetting that "people who drink beer, think
beer." Suppose a question of great public interest
afloat:&mdash;"Reports are abroad, precisely of the proper pitch of
absurdity, for the greedy swallowing of the great grey-goggle-eyed
public, who may be seen standing with her mouth wide open like a
crocodile, with her hands in her breeches-pockets, at the crosses
of cities on market-days, gluttonously devouring whatever rumour
flings into her maw&mdash;nor in the least aware that she is all
the time eating wind. People of smallish abilities begin to look
wiser and wiser every day&mdash;their nods seem more
significant&mdash;in the shaking of their heads there is more of
Burleigh&mdash;and in short sentences&mdash;that sound like
apophthegms&mdash;they are apt to impose themselves on their
credulous selves as so many Solomons."</p>
<hr />
<h3>NEW CHURCHES.</h3>
<p>Among the numerous sermons lately preached in pursuance of the
King's letter for the enlargement and building of churches and
chapels, we notice one by the vicar of Dorking, in Surrey, from
which we extract the following:&mdash;"In many places of this
country it is lamentable to behold the ruinous state of churches.
If a man's dwelling-house be decayed, he will never cease till it
be restored; if his barn, where he bestows all his fruits and his
goods, be out of repair, what diligence doth he use to make it
perfect? If the stable for his horse, or the sty for his swine, be
not able to exclude the severity of weather, when the rains fall,
and the winds blow, how careful is he to incur the necessary cost?
Shall we then be so mindful of our common houses, deputed to such
low occupations, and be forgetful toward that house of God, in
which are expounded the words of our eternal salvation&mdash;in
which are administered the sacraments and mysteries of our
redemption?"&mdash;The persuasiveness of this argument is
admirable, and its amiable tone and temper are infinitely more
suitable than the florid appeal.</p>
<p>We also learn that Parliament has already voted a million and a
half of money to the sole use of building churches, and that in the
diocese in which Dorking is situated, thirty-two cases have been
aided by the sum of 6,230<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>But the <i>church of Dorking</i> is in a dilapidated state, and
is capable of containing only one-fifth of the inhabitants. It was
"probably erected about the commencement of the twelfth century;
and the crumbling walls may almost be said to totter under the
massive roof." This <span class="pagenum"><a id="page410" name=
"page410"></a>[pg 410]</span> calls forth the following pious
exhortation: "Our lot is cast in a pleasant place. Let us manifest
our thankfulness to the Giver of every good gift by a structure
dedicated to his service, corresponding with the magnificence of
private mansions, and the natural beauties of local scenery." We
can only wonder that, in a neighbourhood abounding with men of rank
and opulence, such an appeal is necessary.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SHORT-HAND.</h3>
<p>"Sound is the gauge of short-hand, and connexion the master-key
for deciphering." Such is one of the axioms in Mr. Harding's eighth
edition of his very valuable little "System of
Short-Hand,"&mdash;to which, by way of pleasant illustration, he
appends, the "Dirge on Miss LN G," copied by us from the "New
Monthly Magazine;" but we give Mr. H. credit for the present
application. We could write a whole number of the MIRROR on the
advantages of short-hand to the community; but as that would not be
a practical illustration, we desist. Only think of the "Times"
newspaper being scores of miles from town before half London has
risen; and the Duke of Bedford, reading the previous night's
debates at his breakfast table at Woburn Abbey. What would all Mr.
Applegath's machinery do towards producing the newspaper without
the aid of short-hand, which makes its expedition second only to
thought. Half an hour's delay of "the paper" makes us fret and fume
and condemn the fair provider of our breakfast&mdash;for
over-roasted coffee and stale eggs&mdash;all because the paper is
not "come;" but when would it come without short-hand? why at
dinner-time, and that would make short work of a day&mdash;for
thousands cannot set to work till they have consulted it as a
mainspring of action. People who aim at the short cuts to knowledge
should study stenography, and for this purpose they will do well to
provide themselves with Mr. Harding's System, which will be as good
as "a cubit to a man's height."</p>

<h3>THE LIBRARY AT HOLKHAM.</h3>
<p>The manuscripts of Lord Coke are in the possession of his
descendant, Mr. Coke, of Norfolk, his representative through the
female issue of Lord Leicester, the male heir of the chief justice.
At this gentleman's princely mansion of Holkham, is one of the
finest collections, or, indeed, libraries of manuscripts anywhere
preserved; certainly the finest in any private individual's
possession. It partly consists of the chief justice's papers; the
rest, and the bulk of it, was collected by that accomplished
nobleman who built the mansion, the last male heir of the great
lawyer. He had spent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page411" name=
"page411"></a>[pg 411]</span> many years abroad, where his taste
was improved and his general education perfected. He collected a
vast number of the most valuable manuscripts. Of these the
exquisitely illuminated missals, and other writings of a similar
description, which would from their perfect beauty and great rarity
bear the highest price in the market, are certainly by far the
least precious in the eyes of literary men. Many of the finest
<i>codices</i> of the Greek, Latin, and old Italian classics are to
be found in this superb collection. Among others are no less than
thirteen of Livy, a favourite author of Lord Leicester, whom he had
made some progress in editing, when he learnt that Drakenborchius,
the well known German critic, had proceeded further in the same
task, and generously handed over to him the treasures of his
library. The excellent edition of that commentator makes constant
reference to the Holkham manuscripts, under the name of <i>MSS.
Lovelliana</i>, from the title of Lovell; Lord Leicester not having
then been promoted to the earldom. Mr. Coke, with a becoming
respect for the valuable collection of his ancestors, was desirous
to have the manuscripts unfolded, bound, and arranged, both with a
view to their preservation and to the facility of consulting them.
They had lain for half a century neglected, and in part verging
towards decay, when he engaged his valued friend, William Roscoe,
to undertake the labour so congenial to his taste and habits, of
securing these treasures from the ravages of time. From the great
number of the manuscripts, the state in which many of them were,
and the distance of Mr. Roscoe's residence, this was necessarily a
work of time. After above ten years employed on it, the task is now
finished. Each work is beautifully and classically bound; and to
each Mr. Roscoe has prefixed, in his own fair hand writing, a short
account of the particular manuscript, with the bibliographical
learning appertaining to it.&mdash;<i>Library of Useful

<h3>PHRENOLOGY.</h3>
<p>Mr. Crook, of the Phrenological Society, has just published a
"Compendium of Phrenology," which cannot fail to be acceptable to
the ingenious inquirers after that very ingenious science. It is a
lucid little arrangement of principles, and will materially assist
them; but, for our part, we confess we would sooner take the public
opinion of the contents of our cranium than that of a whole society
of phrenologists; and if our head be as full as our sheet, we shall
be content. But, joking apart, the little synopsis before us cannot
be too highly recommended; and by way of hint to some friends who
send us witty articles for "the Gatherer," we take the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Wit. <i>Primitive Power.</i> Perception of the disjunction or
incongruity of ideas; the analytical faculty. <i>Uses</i>:
Separation of compound or general ideas into those that are
elementary or more simple; knowledge of characteristic differences
and discrepance. <i>Abuses</i>: A disposition to jest or ridicule;
irony, sarcasm, and satire, without respect to truth, or the
circumstances of person, place, or time. <i>Organ</i>, on the other
side of Causality.</p>
<p>"It is not the definition of Wit, but the function of a
particular portion of the brain at which I aim. Dr. Spurzheim, in
some of his works, calls the faculty connected with this organ,
'the feeling of the ludicrous;' in his later ones, 'Gayness,' and
'Mirthfulness.' But each of these is properly an effect, not a
primitive power. The ludicrous owes its origin to the contrariety
between the parts or means, as perceived by this faculty, and the
general whole, or purpose, perceived by Comparison, or the
necessary connexion perceived by Causality; and Gaiety, Mirth, and
Laughter, arise from the mutual influence and reaction of the
feelings. Some kinds of contrariety or incongruity excite one class
of feelings, other kinds altogether different feelings; and
consequently, according to the faculty or combination of faculties
affected, the kinds of mirth and laughter are varied from the
Sardonic grin of Destructiveness to the lover's smile. This view of
the origin of laughter enables us to give a satisfactory answer to
the hitherto perplexing question, 'Why is man the only laughing
animal?'"</p>

<h3>PORTRAIT PAINTING.</h3>
<p>The good portrait painter always flatters; for it is his
business, not, indeed, to alter and amend features, complexion, or
mien, but to select and fix (which it demands genius and sense to
do) the best appearance which these ever do wear. Happy the
creature of sense and passion who has always with him that self
which he could take pleasure in contemplating! Happy&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page412" name="page412"></a>[pg
412]</span> pass graver considerations&mdash;the fair one whose
countenance continues as youthful as her attire! When Queen
Elizabeth's wrinkles waxed deep and many, it is reported that an
unfortunate master of the mint incurred disgrace by a too faithful
shilling; the die was broken, and only one mutilated impression is
now in existence. Her maids of honour took the hint, and were
thenceforth careful that no fragment of looking-glass should remain
in any room of the palace. In fact, the lion-hearted lady had not
heart to look herself in the face for the last twenty years of her
life; but we nowhere learn that she quarrelled with Holbein's
portraitures of her youth, or those of her stately prime of
viraginity by De Heere and Zucchero.</p>
<p>He who has "neither done things worthy to be written, nor
written things worthy to be read," takes the trouble of
transmitting his portrait to posterity to very little purpose. If
the picture be a bad one, it will soon find its way to the garret;
if good, as a work of art, it will perpetuate the fame, probably
the name, indeed, of the artist alone. These are the <i>obscurorum
virorum imagines</i> which, as Walpole said, "are christened
commonly in galleries, like children at the Foundling Hospital,
<i>by chance</i>"&mdash;Q. Rev.</p>

<h3>LOSING A SHOE AND A DINNER.</h3>
<p>As Ozias Linley, Sheridan's brother-in-law, was one morning
setting out on horseback for his curacy, a few miles from Norwich,
his horse threw off one of his shoes. A lady, who observed the
accident, thought it might impede Mr. Linley's journey, and seeing
that he himself was unconscious of it, politely reminded him that
one of his horse's shoes had just come off. "Thank you, madam,"
replied Linley; "will you then have the goodness to put it on for
me?"</p>
<p>Linley one day received a card to dine with the late archbishop
of Canterbury, who was then bishop of Norwich. Careless into what
hole or corner he threw his invitations, he soon lost sight of the
card, and forgot it altogether. A year revolved, when, on wiping
the dust from some papers he had stuck on the glass over the
chimney, the bishop's invitation for a certain day in the month (he
did not think of the year one instant,) stared him full in the
face, and taking it for granted that it was a recent one, he
dressed himself on the appointed day, and proceeded to the palace.
But his diocesan was not in London, a circumstance of which, though
a matter of some notoriety to the clergy of the diocese, he was
quite unconscious; and he returned dinnerless home.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SENTIMENT AND APPETITE.</h3>
<p>We remember an amiable enthusiast, a worshiper of nature after
the manner of Rousseau, who, being melted into feelings of
universal philanthropy by the softness and serenity of a spring
morning, resolved, that for that day, at least, no injured animal
should pollute his board; and having recorded his vow, walked six
miles to gain a hamlet, famous for fish dinners, where, without an
idea of breaking his sentimental engagement, he regaled himself on
a small matter of crimped cod and oyster sauce&mdash;Q. Rev.</p>

<h3>FORTIFICATION.</h3>
<p>The walls of Tenchira, in Africa, form one of the most perfect
remaining specimens of ancient fortification. They are a mile and a
half in circuit, defended by 26 quadrangular towers, and admitting
no entrance but by two opposite gates.</p>

<h3>PIGS.</h3>
<p>One day when Giotto, the painter, was taking his Sunday walk, in
his best attire, with a party of friends, at Florence, and was in
the midst of a long story, some pigs passed suddenly by, and one of
them, running between the painter's legs, threw him down. When he
got on his legs again, instead of swearing a terrible oath at the
pig on the Lord's day, as a graver man might have done, he
observed, laughing, "People say these beasts are stupid, but they
seem to me to have some sense of justice, for I have earned several
thousands of crowns with their bristles, but I never gave one of
them even a ladleful of soup in my life."&mdash;<i>Lanzi.</i></p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>FLIES.</h3>
<p>Cruelty to animals is a subject which has deservedly attracted
parliamentary investigation. It is not beneath the dignity of a
Christian legislator to prevent the unnecessary sufferings of the
meanest of created things; and a law which is dictated by humanity
can surely be no disgrace to the statute-book. Who that has
witnessed the barbarous and unmanly sports of the cock-pit and the
stake&mdash;the fiendlike ingenuity displayed by the lord of the
creation in teaching his dependents to torture, mangle, and destroy
each other for his own amusement&mdash;the cruelties of the greedy
and savage task-master towards the dumb labourer whose strength has
decayed in his service&mdash;or the sufferings of the helpless
brute that drags with pain and difficulty its maimed carcass to
Smithfield&mdash;what reasonable being that has witnessed all or
any of this, will venture to affirm that interference is officious
and uncalled for? Yet it is certain that Mr. Martin acted properly
and wisely in excluding flies from the operation of his
act&mdash;well knowing, as he must have done, that the feeling of
the majority was decidedly averse from affording parliamentary
countenance and immunity to those descendants of the victims of
Domitian's just indignation; although it is understood that such a
provision would have been cordially supported by the advocates for
universal toleration. The simple question for consideration would
be, whether the conduct and principles of the insect species have
undergone such a material change as to entitle them to new and
extraordinary enactments in their favour? Have they entirely
divested themselves of their licentious and predatory habits, and
learnt now for the first time to distinguish between right and
wrong? Do they understand what it is to commit sacrilege? To
intrude into the sanctum sanctorum of the meat-safe? To rifle and
defile the half roseate, half lily-white charms of a virgin ham? To
touch with unhallowed proboscis the immaculate lip of beauty, the
unprotected scalp of old age, the savoury glories of the kitchen?
To invade with the most reckless indifference, and the most wanton
malice, the siesta of the alderman or the philosopher? To this we
answer in the eloquent and emphatic language of the late Mr.
Canning&mdash;<i>No</i>! Unamiable and unconciliating monsters! The
wildest and most ferocious inhabitants of the desert may be
reclaimed from their savage nature, and taught to become the
peaceful denizens of a menagerie&mdash;but ye are altogether
untractable and untameable. Gratitude and sense of shame, the
better parts of instinct, have never yet interposed their sacred
influence to prevent the commission of one treacherous or
unbecoming action of yours. The holy rites of hospitality are by
you abused and set at naught; and the very roof which shelters you
is desecrated with the marks of your irreverential contempt for all
things human and divine. Would that&mdash;(and the wish is
expressed more in sorrow than in anger)&mdash;would that your
entire species were condensed into one enormous bluebottle, that we
might crush you all at a single swoop!</p>
<p>Many, calling themselves philanthropists and Christians, have
omitted to squash a fly when they had an opportunity of so doing;
nay, some of these people have even been known to go the length of
writing verses on the occasion, in which they applaud themselves
for their own humane disposition, and congratulate the object of
their mistaken mercy on its narrow escape from impending fate.
There is nothing more wanting than to propose the establishment of
a Royal Humane Society for the resuscitation of flies apparently
drowned or suffocated. Can it possibly be imagined by the man who
has succeeded after infinite pains in rescuing a greedy and
intrusive insect from a gin-and-watery grave in his own vile
potations, that he has thereby consulted the happiness of his
fellow creatures, or promoted the cause of decency, cleanliness,
good order, and domestic comfort? Let him watch the career of the
mischievous little demon which he has thus been the means of
restoring to the world, when he might have arrested its progress
for ever. Observe the stout and respectable gentleman, loved,
honoured, and esteemed in all the various relations of father,
husband, friend, citizen, and Christian, who is on cushioned sofa
composing himself for his wonted nap, after a dinner in substance
and quantity of the most satisfactory description, and not
untempered by a modicum of old port. His amiable partner, with that
refined delicacy and sense of decorum peculiar to the female sex,
has already withdrawn with her infant progeny, leaving her good
man, as she fondly imagines, to enjoy the sweets of uninterrupted
repose. At one moment we behold him slumbering softly as an
infant&mdash;"so tranquil, helpless, stirless, and unmoved;" in the
next, we remark with surprise sundry violent twitches and
contortions of the limbs, as though the sleeper were under the
operation of galvanism, or suffering from the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page414" name="page414"></a>[pg 414]</span> pangs
of a guilty conscience. Of what hidden crime does the memory thus
agitate him&mdash;breaking in upon that rest which should steep the
senses in forgetfulness of the world and its cares? On a sudden he
starts from his couch with an appearance of frenzy!&mdash;his
nostrils dilated, his eyes gleaming with immoderate
excitation&mdash;an incipient curse quivering on his lips, and
every vein swelling&mdash;every muscle tense with fearful and
passionate energy of purpose. Is he possessed with a devil, or does
he meditate suicide, that his manner is so wild and hurried? With
impetuous velocity he rushes to the window, and beneath his
vehement but futile strokes, aimed at a scarcely visible, and
certainly impalpable object, the fragile glass flies into
fragments, the source of future colds and curtain lectures without
number. The immediate author of so much mischief, it is true, is
the diminutive vampire which is now making its escape with
cold-blooded indifference through a very considerable fracture in
one of the panes; but surely the person who saved from destruction,
and may thus be considered to have given existence to the cause of
all this loss of temper and of property, cannot conscientiously
affirm that <i>his</i> withers are unwrung! Mercy and forbearance
are very great virtues when exercised with proper discretion; but
man owes a paramount duty to society, with which none of the
weaknesses, however amiable, of his nature should be allowed to
interfere. It is no mercy to pardon and let loose upon the
community one who, having already been convicted of manifold
delinquencies, only waits a convenient season for adding to the
catalogue of his crimes; and what is larceny, or felony, or even
treason, compared with the perpetration of the outrages above
attempted to be described?&mdash;We pause for a reply.</p>
<p>Summer is a most delectable&mdash;a most glorious season. We,
who are fond of basking as a lizard, and whose inward spirit dances
and exults like a very mote in the sun-beam, always hail its
approach with rapture; but our anticipations of bright and serene
days&mdash;of blue, cloudless, and transparent skies&mdash;of
shadows the deeper from intensity of surrounding light&mdash;of
yellow corn-fields, listless rambles, and lassitude rejoicing in
green and sunny banks&mdash;are allayed by this one consideration,
that</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>Waked by the summer ray, the reptile young</p>

<p>Swarming they pour.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Go where you will, it is not possible to escape these "winged
reptiles." They abound exceedingly in all sunny spots; nor in the
shady lane do they not haunt every bush, and lie perdu under every
leaf, thence sallying forth on the luckless wight who presumes to
molest their "solitary reign;" they hang with deliberate
importunity over the path of the sauntering pedestrian, and fly
with the flying horseman, like the black cares (that is to say,
blue devils) described by the Roman lyrist. Within doors they
infest, harpy-like, the dinner-table&mdash;</p>

<p>and hover in impending clouds over the sugar basin at tea; in
the pantry it is buz; in the dairy it is buz; in the kitchen it is
buz; one loud, long-continued, and monotonous buz! Having little
other occupation than that of propagating their species, the
natural consequence, as we may learn from Mr. Malthus, is that
their numbers increase in a frightfully progressive ratio from year
to year; and it has at length become absolutely necessary that some
decisive measures should be adopted to counteract the growing
evil.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, he would not, perhaps, be considered to speak
rashly or unadvisedly, who should affirm, that no earthly creature,
of the same insignificant character and pretensions, is the agent
of nearly so much mischief as the fly.&mdash;What a blessed order
of things would immediately ensue, if every one of them was to be
entirely swept away from the face of the earth! This most
wished-for event, we fear, it will never be our lot to witness; but
it may be permitted to a sincere patriot, in his benevolent and
enthusiastic zeal for the well-being of his country, to indulge in
aspirations that are tinged with a shade of extravagance. With
respect, however, to the above mentioned vermin, the idea of their
total annihilation may not be altogether chimerical. We know that
the extirpation of wolves from England was accomplished by the
commutation of an annual tribute for a certain number of their
heads; and it is well worth the consideration of the legislature,
whether, by adopting a somewhat similar principle, they may not rid
the British dominions of an equally great and crying nuisance. The
noble Duke, now at the head of his Majesty's Government, has it in
his power to add another ray to his illustrious name, to secure the
approbation and gratitude of all classes of the community, and to
render his ministry for ever memorable, by the accomplishment of so
desirable an object. In the mean time, let the Society of Arts
offer their next large gold medal to the person <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page415" name="page415"></a>[pg 415]</span> who
shall invent the most ingenious and destructive fly-trap. A certain
quantity of quassia might be distributed gratis at Apothecaries'
Hall, as vaccinatory matter is at the Cow-pox Hospital, with very
considerable effect; and an act of parliament should be passed
without delay, declaring the wilful destruction of a spider to be
felony.&mdash;<i>Blackwood's Magazine.</i></p>

<h3>A GOOD FELLOW.</h3>
<p>The secretary of a literary society being requested to draw up
"<i>a definition of a good fellow</i>," applied to the members of
the club, individually, for such hints as they could furnish, when,
he received the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Golightly</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is one who rides blood
horses, drives four-in-hand, speaks when he's spoken to, sings when
he's asked, always turns his back on a dun, and never on a
friend.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Le Blanc</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is one who studies
deep, reads trigonometry, and burns love songs; has a most cordial
aversion for dancing and D'Egville, and would rather encounter a
cannon than a fancy ball.</p>
<p>Hon. <i>G. Montgomery</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is one who abhors
moralists and mathematics, and adores the classics and Caroline
Mowbray.</p>
<p>Sir <i>T. Wentworth</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is one who attends
the Fox-dinners, who goes to the Indies to purchase independence,
and would rather encounter a buffalo than a boroughmonger.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>M. Sterling</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is a good neighbour,
a good citizen, a good relation; in short, a good man.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>M. Farlane</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is a bonnie braw John
Hielandman.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>O'Connor</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is one who talks loud
and swears louder; cares little about learning, and less about his
neckcloth; loves whiskey, patronizes bargemen, and wears nails in
his shoes.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Musgrave</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is
prime&mdash;flash&mdash;and bang-up.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Burton</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is one who knows "what's
what," keeps accounts, and studies Cocker.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Rowley</i>.&mdash;A good fellow likes turtle and cold
punch, drinks Port when he can't get Champagne, and dines on mutton
with Sir Robert, when he can't get venison at my lord's.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Lozell</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is something compounded
of the preceding.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Oakley</i>.&mdash;A good fellow is something perfectly
different from the preceding,&mdash;or Mr. Oakley is an ass.</p>
<hr />
<h3>MERCHANT TAILORS' SCHOOL.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>At Merchant Tailors' School, what time</p>
<p class="i2">Old Bishop held the rod,</p>
<p>The boys rehearsed the old man's rhyme</p>
<p class="i2">Whilst he would smile and nod.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Apart I view'd a little child</p>
<p class="i2">Who join'd not in the game:</p>
<p>His face was what mammas call mild</p>
<p class="i2">And fathers dull and tame.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Pitying the boy, I thus address'd</p>
<p class="i2">The pedagogue of verse&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why doth he not, Sir, like the rest,</p>

<p class="i2">"He's not in Nature's debt;</p>
<p>His ears so tight are seal'd, he can-</p>
<p class="i2">Not learn his alphabet."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I cried:&mdash;whereat to me</p>

<h3>ROYAL LEARNING.</h3>
<p>The king of Persia made many inquiries of Sir Harford Jones
respecting America, saying, "What sort of a place is it? How do you
get at it? Is it underground, or how?"</p>
<hr />
<h3>COMPLIMENT MAL&mdash;APROPOS.</h3>
<p>Napoleon was once present at the performance of one of
Pasiello's operas, in which was introduced an air by Cimarosa.
Pasiello was in the box with the emperor, and received many
compliments during the evening. At length, when the air by Cimarosa
was played, the emperor turned round, and taking Pasiello by the
hand, exclaimed, "By my faith, my friend, the man who has composed
that air, may proclaim himself the greatest composer in Europe."
"It is Cimarosa's," feebly articulated Pasiello. "I am sorry for
it; but I cannot recall what I have said."</p>
<hr />
<p>A gentleman taking an apartment, said to the landlady, "I assure
you, madam, I never left a lodging but my landlady shed tears." She
answered, "I hope it was not, Sir, because you went away without
paying."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
